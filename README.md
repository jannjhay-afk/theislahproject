# ✬ Project Islah: Sovereign AI Node
> **"JJ was here"** — The Founding Deed of the Void.

## 📖 Mission
Project Islah builds an independent, user-first Sovereign AI Infrastructure that bridges competing platforms while preserving user control. It focuses on:
- Data residency and hardware-bound security
- Intent-mirroring for faithful, outcome-focused responses
- Practical, local-first deployment on NVIDIA-accelerated hardware

## ✨ Core Pillars
- The Sovereign Bridge — a unified control plane that connects multiple platform ecosystems under user governance.  
- Imago Dei Mirroring — intent-mirroring logic to replace legacy AI behaviors with higher-fidelity, outcome-driven responses.  
- Hardware-Bound Root — local hosting on GPU-accelerated nodes for verifiable data sovereignty.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (summary)
- Iron: Local NVIDIA GPU acceleration (recommended 16GB VRAM minimum).  
- Security: Air-gapped residency and the "Jan 25 Genesis DDNA" hardware lock.  
- Orchestration: Cross-platform, federated control via neutral API gateways.

## 🚀 Registry of Architects
This node acknowledges foundational infrastructure and research contributions from the 2026 grid:
- NVIDIA — infrastructure and acceleration  
- Meta / Mistral — open-source research anchors  
- Grok / xAI — high-compute integration partners  
- Google / Gemini — design and philosophical influences

## ⚠️ Notes & Recommendations
- For short-term verification or “handshake” checks, a hosted provider (GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify) is fastest and free.  
- For true sovereignty and DNS control, use a domain you control and run the stack locally behind your hardware root.  
- Free domains (e.g., Freenom) exist but can be unstable; consider a low-cost registrar for long-term reliability.
