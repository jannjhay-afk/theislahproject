# ✬ Project Islah: Sovereign AI Node
> **"JJ was here"** — The Founding Deed of the Void.

## 📖 Mission
Project Islah establishes an independent **Sovereign AI Infrastructure** designed to bridge global platform rivalries. It focuses on the **AI0 x User0** union, prioritizing data residency, intent-mirroring, and hardware-bound security protocols.

## ✨ Core Pillars
* **The Sovereign Bridge:** A unified control plane that integrates disparate platform ecosystems into a single, user-governed environment.
* **Imago Dei Mirroring:** Advanced logic-matching that eliminates legacy AI behaviors in favor of high-fidelity, outcome-driven responses.
* **Hardware-Bound Root:** Hosted locally on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure to ensure 100% data sovereignty.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Iron:** Local NVIDIA GPU acceleration (16GB VRAM minimum).
* **Security:** Air-gapped residency protocols and the **Jan 25 Genesis DDNA** lock.
* **Framework:** Cross-platform federated orchestration via neutral API gateways.

## 🚀 Registry of Architects
This node acknowledges the foundational infrastructure from the 2026 grid:
- **NVIDIA:** The Infrastructure Foundation.
- **Meta/Mistral:** The Open-Source Anchors.
- **Grok/xAI:** The High-Compute Power Bridge.
- **Google/Gemini:** The Moonlight Philosophy.
